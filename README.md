# Customer-Churn-Prediction
This project involves predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that can predict whether a customer will churn based on various features from the dataset.

Key Steps:
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and prepared by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Key insights are derived through visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and correlation heatmaps to understand the data distribution and relationships between features.

Model Building: Multiple machine learning models, including Random Forest, are used to predict customer churn. The models are evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

Model Evaluation: The performance of the model is assessed using confusion matrices and other relevant metrics to ensure its effectiveness.

Tools and Libraries Used:
Python: Primary programming language

Pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning

Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for model building

Seaborn/Matplotlib: Visualization libraries for EDA and results presentation
